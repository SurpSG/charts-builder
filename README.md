----- Detailed description -----

After the user provides a path to the .csv file in the text box, and hits "Execute" the code should plot two graphs, depending on the value of the checkbox.

If the checkbox is unchecked (see GraphUnchecked.png)
The top graph is the cumulative number of people who have been marked as "opened", i.e. had "Opened = Y"
The bottom graph is the cumulative number of people who have been marked as "clicked", i.e. had "Clicked = Y"
The x-axis should be the values in the 'TimeToOpen' column

If the checkbox is checked (see GraphChecked.png)
The top graph has two lines, one for each gender's cumulative number of people who have been marked as "opened"
The top graph has two lines, one for each gender's cumulative number of people who have been marked as "clicked"
The x-axis should be the values in the 'TimeToClick' column
